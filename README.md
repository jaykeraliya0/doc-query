# DocQuery

**doc-query** is a sophisticated AI-powered document query system designed to facilitate seamless interaction with PDF documents. Users can upload PDF files and ask questions related to the content of those documents. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, the system provides real-time responses to user queries, ensuring an intuitive and efficient user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Document**: Users start by uploading a PDF document to the system. The document is stored securely in an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. **Indexing with OpenAI API**: Upon upload, the system generates an index vector for the document using the OpenAI API. This index vector is a representation of the document's content and is crucial for accurate query responses.
3. **Storage in Pinecone Vector Database**: The index vector is stored in the Pinecone vector database, ensuring efficient retrieval and comparison during query processing.
4. **User Query**: Once the document is indexed, users can pose questions based on the content of the PDF. These queries are processed in real-time.
5. **Query Processing**: To answer the user's query, the system first identifies similarities between the query and the indexed documents stored in the Pinecone database. This narrowed-down set of documents serves as the context for the subsequent step.
6. **AI Response Generation**: The system utilizes a GPT model, taking into account the identified context (similar documents), previous conversations, and the original user query. The model generates a response tailored to the user's query and context.
7. **Storage and Presentation**: The generated response from the AI model is stored in the database for future reference and is promptly displayed to the user. This ensures a seamless and efficient interaction flow.
